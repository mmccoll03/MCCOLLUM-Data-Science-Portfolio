# MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio
 A repository for Data Science Projects and Assignments

## Update 2/9/25
 https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app
I created a basic streamlit app using olympic data from Tidy Tuesday data. It offers some basic filtering functionality to view the stats for olympic teams and athletes throughout history. View the README within the basic-streamlit-app folder to experiment with the streamlit app.

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas and streamlit
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions
 - Ability to create an interactice dashboard to present data

 This complements my overall portfolio by showing I know how to made data look readable and meaningful in an interactive and accessible way. 

## Update 3/12/25 
 https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project
This Project seeks to apply Tidy Data Principles to the Mutant Moneyball dataset. In this project, I use pandas to clean and organize my data from a wide to long format and provide some visualizations of the data. 

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions

 This complements my overall portfolio by showcasing important data science skills that would prove helpful in academic or professional environments.
