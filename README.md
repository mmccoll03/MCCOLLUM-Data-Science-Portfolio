## Basic Streamlit App (2/9/25)
 [basic-streamlit-app →](https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
 
 
I created a basic streamlit app using olympic data from Tidy Tuesday data. It offers some basic filtering functionality to view the stats for olympic teams and athletes throughout history. View the README within the basic-streamlit-app folder to experiment with the streamlit app.

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas and streamlit
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions
 - Ability to create an interactice dashboard to present data

 This complements my overall portfolio by showing I know how to made data look readable and meaningful in an interactive and accessible way. 

## Tidy Data Project (3/17/25)
 [TidyData-Project →](https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
 

This Project seeks to apply Tidy Data Principles to the Mutant Moneyball dataset. In this project, I use pandas to clean and organize my data from a wide to long format and provide some visualizations of the data. 

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions

 This complements my overall portfolio by showcasing important data science skills that would prove helpful in academic or professional environments. 

 ## Supervised Machine Learning Streamlit App (4/14/25)
 [MLStreamlitApp →](https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

 This project uses streamlit to create an interactive dashboard to explore and learn about different
 concepts in supervised Machine Learning. I use python to create showcases of linear regression, logistic regression on a perceptron, K nearest neighbors, and decision trees. This app allows users to upload their own datasets to complete analysis using these ML algorithms, or they can look at some demos with datasets I provide.

 By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with Python and Streamlit
 - The ability to visualize data and tune hyperparameters in a unique way
 - To create a comprehensive, and easy-to-use streamlit app for everyone to use.

 This project adds to my portfolio by showing my ability to explain and demonstrate complicated topics in data science in Machine Learning in a fun and interactive way. 

 ## Unsupervised Machine Learning Streamlit App (5/06/25)  
[MLUnsupervisedApp →](https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)

This companion app showcases key **unsupervised** learning methods with Streamlit, letting users upload their own data or choose from built-in examples:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality, inspect scree plots, biplots, and compare downstream classification performance.  
- **K-Means Clustering:** Segment data into *K* groups, explore elbow plots and silhouette scores, and visualize clusters in 2D.  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Build and interactively “cut” dendrograms, view clusters in both 2D and 3D, and perform silhouette analysis.

This project highlights:
- Advanced use of PCA and clustering algorithms in an interactive setting  
- My ability to preprocess, visualize, and interpret complex unsupervised workflows  
- Creation of a polished, educational app that complements the supervised ML portfolio  

This project adds to my portfolio by showing my ability to explain and demonstrate complicated topics in data science in Machine Learning in a fun and interactive way. 

Together, paired with supervised machine learning app, these projects demonstrate a full spectrum of machine learning expertise—from prediction and classification to discovery of hidden structure—using Streamlit as a powerful, accessible interface
