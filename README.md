# MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio
 A repository for Data Science Projects and Assignments

## Update 2/9/25
 https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app
 
 
I created a basic streamlit app using olympic data from Tidy Tuesday data. It offers some basic filtering functionality to view the stats for olympic teams and athletes throughout history. View the README within the basic-streamlit-app folder to experiment with the streamlit app.

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas and streamlit
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions
 - Ability to create an interactice dashboard to present data

 This complements my overall portfolio by showing I know how to made data look readable and meaningful in an interactive and accessible way. 

## Update 3/12/25 
 https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project
 

This Project seeks to apply Tidy Data Principles to the Mutant Moneyball dataset. In this project, I use pandas to clean and organize my data from a wide to long format and provide some visualizations of the data. 

By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
 - Ability to clean and manipulate data
 - Ability to visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions

 This complements my overall portfolio by showcasing important data science skills that would prove helpful in academic or professional environments. 

 ## Supervised Machine Learning Streamlit App (4/14/25)
 https://github.com/mmccoll03/MCCOLLUM-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp

 This project uses streamlit to create an interactive dashboard to explore and learn about different
 concepts in supervised Machine Learning. I use python to create showcases of linear regression, logistic regression on a perceptron, K nearest neighbors, and decision trees. This app allows users to upload their own datasets to complete analysis using these ML algorithms, or they can look at some demos with datasets I provide.

 By completing this project, I hope to illustrate:
 - My proficiency with Python and Streamlit
 - The ability to visualize data and tune hyperparameters in a unique way
 - To create a comprehensive, and easy-to-use streamlit app for everyone to use.

 This project adds to my portfolio by showing my ability to explain and demonstrate complicated topics in data science in Machine Learning in a fun and interactive way.
