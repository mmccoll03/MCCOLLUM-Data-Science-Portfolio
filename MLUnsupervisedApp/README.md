# MLUnsupervisedApp

## Project Overview

**MLUnsupervisedApp** is an interactive machine learning application built with Python and Streamlit.  
Its goal is to provide users with a hands-on environment to explore key unsupervised learning techniques and dimensionality reduction using real or uploaded datasets.  
With this app, you can:

- **Upload your own dataset or use built-in examples:**  
  - Breast Cancer dataset for PCA  
  - Mall Customers and Country Data for clustering

- **Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning Methods:**
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce dimensionality while preserving structure. View scree plots, feature loadings, and 2D projections.
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Segment data into user-defined clusters using Euclidean distance. Evaluate model performance using silhouette scores and elbow plots.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Build nested clusters visualized through dendrograms. Apply agglomerative clustering using Ward linkage and visualize groupings in 2D and 3D.

- **Tune Hyperparameters Interactively:**  
  Adjust the number of clusters or principal components and observe how these changes affect structure and performance.

- **Visualize Results Effectively:**
  Scree plots, scatter plots, biplots, dendrograms, and 3D projections help uncover hidden patterns in your data.

## Instructions

### Running the App Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLUnsupervisedApp.git
    cd MLUnsupervisedApp
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries:**
    Ensure your `requirements.txt` file is up-to-date. For example, it may include:
    ```
    matplotlib==3.7.2
    numpy==1.24.3
    pandas==2.0.3
    plotly==5.9.0
    scikit_learn==1.3.0
    scipy==1.15.2
    seaborn==0.13.2
    streamlit==1.41.1
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Access the App:**  
   Your browser should open the app automatically. If not, go to `http://localhost:8501`.
